# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## Problem Statement

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve decided that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets.

You are required to help the manager to predict the right group of the new customers.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the necessary packages & modules

### STEP 2:
Load and clean the customer data, handling missing values.

### STEP 3:
Use OrdinalEncoder and LabelEncoder to encode categorical features.

### STEP 4:
Generate a correlation matrix and heatmap, along with a pair plot for data exploration.

### STEP 5:
Apply MinMax scaling to the 'Age' column in the dataset.

### STEP 6:
Create a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras with specified layers and activation functions.

### STEP 7:
Train the model on the scaled training data with early stopping for preventing overfitting.

### STEP 8:
Evaluate the trained model on the test data, save the model, and store necessary data for future predictions.
